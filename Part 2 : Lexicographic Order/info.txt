Let there be array = [0,1,2]. 
Each element represents a city.
Generating all permutations of this array using lexicographic ordering :: 
    [0,1,2]
    [0,2,1]
    [1,0,2]
    [1,2,0]
    [2,0,1]
    [2,1,0]

These n! permuations represents all possible city orderings.
And then we can calculate the total distance with path between city i and city i+1.
And get the smallest total distance, which will be a solution to TSP.

Read the below article for understanding algorithm to generate all possible permuatation using lexicographic ordering.

I have used the above mentioned approach in this article to generate all permuatations.
