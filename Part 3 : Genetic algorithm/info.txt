We are using genetic algorithm with mutation and crossover to generate better permutations of order of cities in each newer generation of population.
Over the period of time it reaches optimal state faster due to crossover and mutations.

Future work can be done in improving the mutation function and crossover function.
Better the crossover and mutation, better the results in each newer population.
