# Travelling-Salesperson-Visualisation

In this project I have tried to visualize the working of Travelling Salesperson problem(TSP) which is a classical computer science problem.

The projects uses the art representation features of p5.js which is an open-source library that simplifies coding for creative projects on the web. It bridges the gap between creative expression and programming, allowing individuals with little to no coding experience to create animations, generate interactive graphics, and build data visualizations.

The project is a combination of multiple parts.
Starting with brute force solution to TSP visualize it's behaviour and move to better solutions.
